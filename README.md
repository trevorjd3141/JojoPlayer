# Jojo Theme Player

After binging Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part 5 I really thought it would be funny to have 'Giornos Theme' play when I press a certain button. This script will do just that you modify the absolute pathing in the .pyw file to wherever your repo is and you install Auto Hot Keys. The .ahk script allows you to determine the key that will trigger the .pyw file. It will work just fine without auto hot keys if you want to run Python from terminal.
Note: I used .pyw instead of .py because I didn't want a console appearing.
